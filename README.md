How the tic tac toe game works: 

Two people input their names, and the board is displayed, with each position marked with its number. 

The person who entered his name first will play, then the second person will play, with the board being checked for if or not it fulfills the win conditions or tie conditions after each play

When the game is over, it displays the name of the winner or says its a tie.
